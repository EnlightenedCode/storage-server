# Storage Server  [![Build Status](http://devtools1.risevision.com:8080/view/Storage%20Server/job/Storage-Server-BranchPush/badge/icon)](http://devtools1.risevision.com:8080/view/Storage%20Server/job/Storage-Server-BranchPush/)

## Introduction

Storage server is the server side module for the storage client.  Together they make up the storage module which is part of the [Rise Vision](http://rva.risevision.com) digital signage management application.  

[Rise Vision](http://rva.risevision.com) runs on Google App Engine and as such requires GAE to operate. It also uses Google Cloud Storage as a datastore.

Chrome is the only supported browser to use to view the Storage Server API Explorer.

## Built With

- Maven (3.2.1 or greater)
- Java (1.7.0_65 SDK or greater)
- GAE (Google App Engine)

## Development 

### Local Development Environment Setup and Installation

#### Linux

* Maven 3 is required so you need to do some things to make sure your apt-get doesn't install an older version of maven.

* clone the repo using Git to your local:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rise-Vision/storage-server.git
```

* cd into the repo directory
```bash
cd storage-server
```

* The [core](https://github.com/Rise-Vision/core) dependencies must be added to a local maven repository *(lib/)* as follows, Create local maven repository in root project *directory/lib* via (once for each file):

``` bash
mvn install:install-file -DlocalRepositoryPath=lib/ \
  -DcreateChecksum=true -Dpackaging=jar \
  -Dfile=lib/jars/com.risevision.core.api -DgroupId=com.risevision.core \
  -DartifactId=api -Dversion=1.0

mvn install:install-file -DlocalRepositoryPath=lib/ \
  -DcreateChecksum=true -Dpackaging=jar \
  -Dfile=lib/jars/com.risevision.directory -DgroupId=com.risevision \
  -DartifactId=directory -Dversion=1.0
```

* Run this command to start the server locally
``` bash
mvn clean install
mvn appengine:devserver
```

* Open a Chrome browser and go to localhost:8888 then click the "API Explorer" link

### Windows
(this walkthrough uses Windows 64 bit 8.1)
* Requires Java SDK which can be downloade and installed via [Oracle Download Page](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/downloads/java-ee-sdk-7-downloads-1956236.html "Oracle Download Page")
* Requires Apache Maven 3.2.3 or greater from the [Maven Download Page](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi "Maven Download Page")
* The Zip file you get for maven extract it to your main C: drive or wherever you want to put it.
* Make sure to update your Environment Variables to add Java sdk and Maven location to your PATH under System Variables.  This is in Control Panel > System > Advance Properties > Environment Variables.  by Default Java in Windows 8 64 bit is located C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.7.0_67\bin so that should be put in your PATH.  Maven should be C:\apache-maven-3.2.3\bin if you installed it to your C: drive. Once both are added to your PATH enviroment variable, open a command prompt as system adminstrator and run this command:

``` bash
mvn -v
Outputs: 
Maven home: C:\apache-maven-3.2.3\bin\..
Java Version: 1.7.0_67, vendor: Oracle Corporation
Java home: C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.7.0_67\jre
```

* this will confirm that maven and java paths are correct and you have both installed correctly.

* With Git Bash for Windows open git bash in the directory that you want to clone the repo to 

* in git bash run this cmd:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rise-Vision/storage-server.git
```

* pull up a command prompt and navigate to the directory where you cloned the Storage-Client repo and cd into the root of the repository.

* The [core](https://github.com/Rise-Vision/core) dependencies must be added to a local maven repository *(lib/)* as follows, Create local maven repository in root project *directory/lib* via (once for each file):

``` bash
mvn install:install-file -DlocalRepositoryPath=lib/ -DcreateChecksum=true -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=lib/jars/com.risevision.core.api -DgroupId=com.risevision.core -DartifactId=api -Dversion=1.0

mvn install:install-file -DlocalRepositoryPath=lib/ -DcreateChecksum=true -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=lib/jars/com.risevision.directory -DgroupId=com.risevision -DartifactId=directory -Dversion=1.0
```

* Run this cmd to start the server locally
``` bash
mvn clean install
mvn appengine:devserver
```

* Open a Chrome browser and go to localhost:8888, click the "API Explorer" link


### Dependencies

* Junit for testing 
* Mockito for mocking and testing
* Google App Engine SDK

#### Rise Vision Core

The local repository is referenced in pom.xml:
``` xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>lib</id>
    <url>file://${basedir}/lib</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```

Each jar file is specified as a dependency in pom.xml:
``` xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.risevision</groupId>
  <artifactId>directory</artifactId>
  <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.risevision.core</groupId>
  <artifactId>api</artifactId>
  <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### External Registrations and Requirements
* Private p12 and client_secret files should go into src/private-keys.  These allow server to server authentication for google cloud storage. (this must be provided on request from the facilitator and is not stored on github)
* To register your own p12 for google app engine please refer to Google's help page on this topic: 
https://developers.google.com/storage/docs/authentication

### Build and Deployment Process

Deploy via
``` bash
mvn appengine:update -Dappengine.version=your-module-version \
-Dappengine.appId=your-app-id
```
